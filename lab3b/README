Project 3B - File System Analysis
CS 111 Winter 2021 - Xu

In this project, we will analyze the summaries and detect errors and inconsistencies from
part A. 
    -Primary: reinforce the basic file system concepts of directory objects, file objects, 
    and free space.
    -Primary: reinforce the implemenation descriptions provided in the text and lectures.
    -Primary: gain experience examining, interpreting and processing information in complex 
    binary data structures.
    -Primary: reinforce the notions of consistency and integrity and apply them to a concrete 
    and non-trivial problem.


Deliverables:
    lab3b.py:
        Python source code for a program that reads a csv file and checks for
        any inconsistencies. Any such inconsistencies are then reported.

    Makefile: Supports 3 targets
        default: Compiles the program from python source code
        clean: Deletes all files created by the Makefile
        dist: Produces tarball used for submission

        Description of files
