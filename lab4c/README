lab4c_tcp.c: C source file that contains code for a program that builds and runs on
    Beaglebone Green Wireless. It sets up a TCP connection in order to read input
    from a server and write output back. In this case, the input and output are
    based on the program from lab 4b, where the Beaglebone gathers temperature 
    readings from its sensor. In addition to the functionality from lab4b, it
    now supports two more mandatory options: --host and --id. The --log option
    is now mandatory as well.

lab4c_tls: Based on the same code described in lab4c_tcp.c above. It sets up a
    secure TLS connection to the server at a specified address and port. 

Makefile: Supports 3 targets. Intended to be run on imbedded system (Beaglebone)
    default: Compiles lab4c_tcp and lab4c_tls from the lab4c_tcp.c and 
             lab4c_tls.c source codes respectively
    clean: Deletes all files created by the Makefile
    dist: Produces tarball used for submission
