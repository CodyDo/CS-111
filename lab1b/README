lab1b-server.c: The source file that contains code which handles the server
aspect of lab1b. It forks a shell process and sends data from the shell to
the client, as well as data from the client to the shell. Server-client
communication is done through a socket. It supports compression through the
use of the zlib library.

lab1b-client.c: The source file that contains code which handles the client
aspcet of lab1b. It sends input from the client keyboard to the server through
a socket, and displays any received data from the server via the same socket.
It supports logging data sent/received as well as compression through the use
of the zlib library.

Makefile: Builds lab1b executable and supports 5 options:
    default: Runs gcc to create a lab1b-server and lab1b-client executable
            from the lab1b-server and lab1b-client source code respectively.
            Utilizes the -lz option to allow zlib usage.
    server: Runs gcc to create a lab1b-server executable. Utilizes the -lz 
            option to allow zlib usage.
    client: Runs gcc to create a lab1b-client executable. Utilizes the -lz 
            option to allow zlib usage.
    clean: Deletes all files created from Makefile 
    dist: Produces the tarbell for submission

Resources: The following two links were used to help me better understand
how to use gethostnameby() and find a print function that could write to 
a buffer:
