Project 4B - Sensors Input
CS 111 Winter 2021 - Xu

lab4b.c: C source file that contains code for a program that builds and runs on
    Beaglebone Green Wireless. It gathers temperature readings from its sensor
    and outputs them to stdout. Has options available to change the frequency of
    readings, the temperature scale, and whether to log readings or not.

Makefile: Supports 4 targets. Intended to be run on imbedded system (Beaglebone)
    default: Compiles the program from the lab4b.c source code
    check: Runs a smoke test of the application
    clean: Deletes all files created by the Makefile
    dist: Produces tarball used for submission

README: Description of files

Resources: Two links to learn the functionality of isdigit and gettimeofday.
