lab1a.c: This is the source file that contains code which sets up a
Character-at-a-time, full duplex terminal with polled input and output
between two processes. It supports a --shell option.

Makefile: Builds lab1a executable and supports 3 options:
    default: Runs gcc to create a lab1a executable from the lab1a.c source code
    clean: Deletes all files created from Makefile 
    dist: Produces the tarbell for submission

Resources: The following two links were used to help me better understand
poll() and kill():
